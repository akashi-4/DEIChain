Looking at the DEIChain blockchain simulation project, I'll focus on what you need to complete for the intermediate delivery. Based on the checklist in the document, here are the specific components you should implement for the intermediate deadline (March 31, 2025):
Required Components for Intermediate Delivery
Transaction Generator

Create the Transaction Generator (TxGen) process
Implement correct reading of command line parameters (reward 1-3, sleep time 200-3000ms)
Set up the mechanism to write transactions to shared memory (Transaction Pool)

Controller 

Implement configuration file reading ("config.cfg")
Validate the configuration data and apply the read configurations
Create the Miner, Validator, and Statistics processes
Set up two shared memory segments (for Transaction Pool and Blockchain Ledger)
Begin implementation for SIGINT signal capture (preliminary)

Miner

Create the specified number of Miner threads according to the configuration file

Log File

Implement synchronized output to both log file ("DEIChain_log.txt") and screen

General Requirements

Create a makefile for building the project
Prepare a diagram (1 A4 page) showing architecture and synchronization mechanisms
Implement preliminary synchronization with suitable mechanisms (semaphores, mutexes or condition variables)

Data Structures to Implement
You'll need to define at least these data structures:

Transaction structure (with ID, reward, sender/receiver, value, timestamp)
Transaction Pool in shared memory (with current_block_id, transactions_pending_set)
Initial structure for blocks

Development Approach

Start by implementing the data structures needed for the system
Create the Controller process first (reads config, sets up IPC, creates other processes)
Implement the Transaction Generator next
Set up the Miner process with its threads
Implement basic logging functionality
Add preliminary synchronization mechanisms

Remember that for the intermediate delivery, you don't need full functionality. The focus is on setting up the processes, shared memory, and basic architecture rather than the complete blockchain simulation logic.
Make sure to prepare the 1-page architecture diagram that describes all the synchronization mechanisms you plan to implement, as this is explicitly required for the intermediate delivery.
